0,Visual Imitation Learning of Non-Prehensile Manipulation Tasks with Dynamics-Supervised Models,A. Mustafa; R. Hanai; I. G. Ramirez-Alpizar; F. Erich; R. Nakajo; Y. Domae; T.

Successful control requires the extraction of features relevant to the target task. In visual imitation learning settings, these features can be learnt by backpropagating the policy loss through the vision backbone. Yet, this approach tends to learn task-specific features with limited generalizability. Alternatively, learning world models can realize more generalizable vision backbones. Utilizing the learnt features, task-specific policies are subsequently trained. Commonly, these models are trained solely to predict the next RGB state from the current state and action taken. But only-RGB prediction might not fully-capture the task-relevant dynamics. In this work, we hypothesize that direct supervision of target dynamic states (Dynamics Mapping) can learn better dynamics-informed world models. Beside the next RGB reconstruction, the world model is also trained to directly predict position, velocity, and acceleration of environment rigid bodies. To verify our hypothesis, we designed a non-prehensile 2D environment tailored to two tasks: ""Balance-Reaching"" and ""Bin-Dropping"". When trained on the first task, dynamics mapping enhanced the task performance under different training configurations (Decoupled, Joint, End-to-End) and policy architectures (Feedforward, Recurrent). Notably, its most significant impact was for world model pretraining boosting the success rate from 21% to 85%. Although frozen dynamics-informed world models could generalize well to a task with in-domain dynamics, but poorly to a one with out-of-domain dynamics.

Nonetheless, traditional vision sensors are prone to diminished reliability in visual perception due to environmental factors such as lighting conditions and occlusions. Depth sensors, such as Time-of-Flight (TOF) and structured light sensors, offer promising opportunities for reliable target pose estimation. However, accurately determining the pose solely based on a single depth image presents significant challenges due to the limited availability of rich appearance and texture information. To comprehensively address this challenge, we investigate the mechanism of feature extraction and representation using depth images, along with the utilization of normal angle and point cloud information derived from the depth images, to achieve robust estimation of the visual target poses. By exploiting the latent information within the depth images, including normal angles and point clouds, we have developed the DMG6D robust target pose estimation framework. Within the DMG6D framework, we first employ physical methods to infer the normal angle and spatial position of each pixel in the depth image. Subsequently, we introduce a three-branch feature extraction and a global feature fusion network to enable a comprehensive depiction of the target object. Finally, a robust pose estimation for the target object is obtained utilizing the least squares method. Experimental results emphatically demonstrate that the proposed DMG6D surpasses existing algorithms in terms of its ability to estimate 6D poses using depth images, effectively underscoring the efficacy of our designed depth image feature extraction strategy.

Partial observability reduces RL performance significantly, and this can be mitigated by augmenting sensor information and data fusion to reflect a more Markovian environment. However, this necessitates an increasingly complex perception module, whose training via RL is complicated due to inherent limitations. As the neural network architecture becomes more complex, the reward function’s effectiveness as an error signal diminishes since the only source of supervision is the reward, which is often noisy, sparse, and delayed. Task-irrelevant elements in images, such as the sky or certain objects, pose additional complexities. Our research adopts an offline-trained encoder to leverage large video datasets through self-supervised learning to learn generalizable representations. Then, we train a head network on top of these representations through DRL to learn to control an ego vehicle in the CARLA AD simulator. This study presents a broad investigation of the impact of different learning schemes for offline-training of encoders on the performance of DRL agents in challenging AD tasks. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by watching BDD100K driving videos can be directly transferred to achieve lane following and collision avoidance in CARLA simulator, in a zero-shot learning fashion. Finally, we explore the impact of various architectural decisions for the RL networks to utilize the transferred representations efficiently. Therefore, in this work, we introduce and validate an optimal way for obtaining suitable representations of the environment, and transferring them to RL networks.

The recent advancements in video understanding technology have enabled robots to interpret human actions from videos and discern the appropriate timing and nature of required robot assistance. However, current vision-based HRC systems mainly focus on capturing human overall actions, neglecting the detailed actions of each hand. This restricts robots from providing finer attentive assistance, such as delivering the required tools to a specific hand. Furthermore, these systems predominantly utilise classification-based action recognition techniques rather than reasoning-involved action segmentation techniques, thereby constraining their practical application. To address above limitations, this paper proposes a vision-based dual-hand action segmentation method for human-robot collaborative assembly (HRCA) scenarios. Initially, graph neural networks are used to capture hand-object interactions for both hands across frames, then these features are integrated with scene features, and finally, temporal convolutional networks are applied to capture temporal dynamics of the integrated features over frames. To better serve the application needs of HRCA, we have refined the action segmentation to atomic action level according to the Human-Robot Shared Assembly Taxonomy, facilitating comprehensive collaboration.

Overcoming challenges in this field involves advanced algorithms, combination of machine learning approaches, as well as the use of sensory data e.g., from cameras and LiDARs. This work addresses the problem of people detection using YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection method, trained on three distinct data sources LiDAR, RGB (color) and ‘thermal’ (long-wave infra-red) images. The rationale for combining multiple-sensory representation relies on the assumption that each sensor has its own advantages and disadvantages, but together they normally complement each other - specially in real-world conditions. LiDAR contributes to a physically-interpretable mapping of the environment, providing precise information regarding size/dimension and location of the objects, while RGB and thermal provide relevant textural features. The sensors have been calibrated w.r.t. each other thus, allowing the LiDAR’s point-clouds to be projected into the image plane, followed by an up-sampling step, to create dense-depth maps (DM) that enable direct use of the YOLO framework.

An example is the deployment of detection and recognition methods on humans, where images are provided by surveillance cameras. This results in the acquisition of great amounts of sensitive data, since the capture and transmission of images taken by such cameras happens unaltered, for them to be received by a server on the network. However, many applications do not explicitly require the identity of a given person in a scene; An anonymized representation containing information of the person’s position while preserving the context of them in the scene suffices. We show how using a customized loss function on region of interests (ROI) can achieve sufficient anonymization such that human faces become unrecognizable while persons are kept detectable, by training an end-to-end optimized autoencoder for learned image compression that utilizes the flexibility of the learned analysis and reconstruction transforms for the task of mutating parts of the compression result. This approach enables compression and anonymization in one step on the capture device, instead of transmitting sensitive, nonanonymized data over the network. Additionally, we evaluate how this anonymization impacts the average precision of pre-trained foundation models on detecting faces (MTCNN) and humans (YOLOv8) in comparison to non-ANN based methods, while considering compression rate and latency.

Assembly pose estimation is a secondary yet highly desirable skill in robotic assembling as it requires more detailed information on object placement as compared to bin picking and pick-and-place tasks.

Numerous established methods employ machine learning in inspection tasks, necessitating specific training data that includes predefined inspection poses and training images essential for the training of models. The acquisition of such data and their integration into an inspection framework is challenging due to the variety in objects and scenes involved and due to additional bottlenecks caused by the manual collection of training data by humans, thereby hindering the automation of visual inspection across diverse domains. This work proposes a solution for automatic path planning using a single depth camera mounted on a robot manipulator. Point clouds obtained from the depth images are processed and filtered to extract object profiles and transformed to inspection target paths for the robot end-effector. The approach relies on the geometry of the object and generates an inspection path that follows the shape normal to the surface.

The classification of fNIRS data in relation to conscious activity holds significance for advancing our understanding of the brain and facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many researchers have turned to deep learning to tackle the classification challenges inherent in fNIRS data due to its strong generalization and robustness. In the application of fNIRS, reliability is really important, and one mathematical formulation of the reliability of confidence is calibration. However, many researchers overlook the important issue of calibration. To address this gap, we propose integrating calibration into fNIRS field and assess the reliability of existing models. Surprisingly, our results indicate poor calibration performance in many proposed models. To advance calibration development in the fNIRS field, we summarize three practical tips. Through this letter, we hope to emphasize the critical role of calibration in fNIRS research and argue for enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based predictions in fNIRS classification tasks.

Although recent studies on active vision have shown some potential for agricultural tasks, each model has been designed and validated on a unique environment that would not easily be replicated for benchmarking novel methods being developed later. In this paper, we introduce a dataset, so-called DAVIS-Ag, for promoting more extensive research on Domain-inspired Active VISion in Agriculture. To be specific, we leveraged our open-source ""AgML"" framework and 3D plant simulator of ""Helios"" to produce 502K RGB images from 30K densely sampled spatial locations in 632 synthetic orchards. Moreover, plant environments of strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes are considered at two different scales (i.e., Single-Plant and Multi-Plant). Useful labels are also provided for each image, including (1) bounding boxes and (2) instance segmentation masks for all identifiable fruits, and also (3) pointers to other images of the viewpoints that are reachable by an execution of action so as to simulate active viewpoint selections at each time step. Using DAVIS-Ag, we visualize motivating examples where fruit visibility can dramatically change depending on the pose of the camera view primarily due to occlusions by other components, such as leaves. Furthermore, we present several baseline models with experiment results for benchmarking in the task of target visibility maximization. Transferability to real strawberry environments is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using the dataset for prototyping real-world solutions.

Our method uses only depth information, making it more applicable for many industrial use cases, as color information is seldom available. The network is composed of two parallel components for computing object and scene features. The features are then combined to create matches used for pose estimation. The parallel structure allows for pre-processing of the individual parts, which decreases the run-time.Using a zero-shot network allows for a very short set-up time, as it is not necessary to train models for new objects. However, as the network is not trained for the specific object, zero-shot pose estimation methods generally have lower accuracy compared with conventional methods. To address this, we reduce the complexity of the task by including the scenario information during training. This is typically not feasible as collecting real data for new tasks drastically increases the cost. However, for zero-shot pose estimation, training for new objects is not necessary and the expensive data collection can thus be performed only once.Our method is trained on 1,500 objects and is only tested on unseen objects. We demonstrate that the trained network can not only accurately estimate poses for novel objects, but also demonstrate the ability of the network on objects outside of the trained class. Test results are also shown on real data. We believe that the presented method is valuable for many real-world scenarios.

Unlike commercial motion capture systems, fiducial marker-based tracking methods, such as AprilTags, can perform relative localization without requiring a static camera setup. However, popular pose estimation methods based on fiducial markers have lower localization accuracy than commercial motion capture systems. We propose Mobile Mo-Cap, a system that utilizes inexpensive near-infrared cameras for accurate relative localization even while in motion. We present a retroreflector feature detector that performs 6- DoF (six degrees-of-freedom) tracking and operates with minimal camera exposure times to reduce motion blur. To evaluate the proposed localization technique while in motion, we mount our Mobile MoCap system, as well as an RGB camera to benchmark against fiducial markers, onto a precision-controlled linear rail and servo. The fiducial marker approach employs AprilTags, which are pervasively used for localization in robotics. We evaluate the two systems at varying distances, marker viewing angles, and relative velocities.

Especially compared to representation learning models, we reduce the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 37%, 49%, and 48% on the PeMS-BAY dataset, respectively. Furthermore, in real-world metro passenger flow data, our framework demonstrates the ability to transfer to infer future information of new cold-start instances, with gains of 15%, 19%, and 18%.

Industry 4.0 has made available an increasing amount of data that enable data-driven Causal Discovery (CD). Considering the growing number of recently proposed CD methods, it is necessary to introduce strict benchmarking procedures on publicly available datasets since they represent the foundation for a fair comparison and validation of different methods. This work introduces two novel public datasets for CD in continuous manufacturing processes. The first dataset employs the well-known Tennessee Eastman simulator for fault detection and process control. The second dataset is extracted from an ultra-processed food manufacturing plant, and it includes a description of the plant, as well as multiple ground truths. These datasets are used to propose a benchmarking procedure based on different metrics and evaluated on a wide selection of CD algorithms.

Alternatively, small non-generic grasp models have been proposed that are tailored to specific objects by, for example, directly predicting the object’s location in 2/3D space, and determining suitable grasp poses by post processing. In both cases, data generation is a bottleneck, as this needs to be separately collected and annotated for each individual object and image. In this work, we tackle these issues and propose a grasping model that is developed in four main steps: 1. Visual object grasp demonstration, 2. Data augmentation, 3.

Most popular CPP approaches are hierarchical and decomposition-based, involving three steps: (1) decomposing the environment into sub-regions (rectangles or polygons) that simplify the generation of space-filling paths, (2) determining a visitation order over these sub-regions via graph search or a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver, and (3) generation of space-filling paths in each sub-region. This approach requires significant processing of the environment and the availability of suitable TSP solvers. Furthermore, step (1) can sometimes fail in non-convex environments or lead to ""over-decomposition"" in cluttered environments. To the best of our knowledge, existing decomposition-free approaches are heuristic or random, and therefore typically inefficient and probabilistically complete. We present a resolution-complete decomposition-free coverage path planner that effectively folds steps (1) and (2) above into a single online search routine, making it significantly easier to integrate into existing robot architectures and applicable to a larger set of environments.

Our benchmark consists of a swarm vs. swarm game in a virtual ROS environment in which the goal of the game is to ""capture"" all agents from the opposing swarm; the game’s high-cadence is a result of the capture rules, which cause agent team sizes to fluctuate rapidly. These rules require players to consider both the number of agents currently at their disposal and the behavior of their opponent’s swarm when they plan actions. We demonstrate our game benchmark with a default human-swarm control system that enables a player to interact with their swarm through a high-level touchscreen interface. The touchscreen interface transforms player gestures into swarm control commands via a low-level decentralized ergodic control framework. We compare our default human-swarm control system to a flocking-based control system, and discuss traits that are crucial for swarm control algorithms and interfaces operating in real-time, high-cadence scenarios like our game benchmark.

Despite its immense computing capacity, it is often underused by the robotics and automation community due to lack of expertise in cloud computing and cloud-based infrastructure. Fog Robotics balances computing and data between cloud edge devices. We propose a software framework, FogROS, as an extension of the Robot Operating System (ROS), the defacto standard for creating robot automation applications and components. It allows researchers to deploy components of their software to the cloud with minimal effort, and correspondingly gain access to additional computing cores, GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs, as well as predeployed software made available by other researchers. FogROS allows a researcher to specify which components of their software will be deployed to the cloud and to what type of computing hardware. We evaluate FogROS on 3 examples: (1) simultaneous localization and mapping (ORB-SLAM2), (2) Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) GPU-based grasp planning, and (3) multi-core motion planning using a 96-core cloud-based server. In all three examples, a component is deployed to the cloud and accelerated with a small change in system launch configuration, while incurring additional latency of 1.2 s, 0.6 s, and 0.5 s due to network communication, the computation speed is improved by 2.6×, 6.0× and 34.2×, respectively.

First, we propose a multi-drone coverage control algorithm by leveraging emerging deep reinforcement learning and design a novel information map to represent dynamic system states. Second, we propose a near-optimal charging scheduling algorithm to navigate each drone to an individual charging slot, and we have proven that there always exists feasible solutions.

The paper's key idea is to capture the variations in the distance-to-collision measurements caused by the uncertainty in state estimation techniques using a Gaussian Process (GP) model. We formulate the planning problem as a chance constraint problem and propose a deterministic constraint that uses the modeled distance function to verify the chance-constraints. We apply Simplicial Homology Global Optimization (SHGO) approach to find the global minimum of the deterministic constraint function along the trajectory and use the minimum value to verify the chance-constraints. Under this formulation, we can show that the optimization function is smooth under certain conditions and that SHGO converges to the global minimum. Therefore, CCGP-MP will always guarantee that all points on a planned trajectory satisfy the given chance-constraints. The experiments in this paper show that CCGP-MP can generate paths that reduce collisions and meet optimality criteria under motion and state uncertainties.

This paper presents a novel end-to-end continuous deep reinforcement learning approach towards autonomous cars' decision-making and motion planning. For the first time, we define both states and action spaces on the Frenet space to make the driving behavior less variant to the road curvatures than the surrounding actors' dynamics and traffic interactions. The agent receives time-series data of past trajectories of the surrounding vehicles and applies convolutional neural networks along the time channels to extract features in the backbone. The algorithm generates continuous spatiotemporal trajectories on the Frenet frame for the feedback controller to track. Extensive high-fidelity highway simulations on CARLA show the superiority of the presented approach compared with commonly used baselines and discrete reinforcement learning on various traffic scenarios.

In this paper, we present a learning model based control strategy for the cup-and-ball game, where a Universal Robots UR5e manipulator arm learns to catch a ball in one of the cups on a Kendama. Our control problem is divided into two sub-tasks, namely (i) swinging the ball up in a constrained motion, and (ii) catching the free-falling ball. The swing-up trajectory is computed offline, and applied in open-loop to the arm. Subsequently, a convex optimization problem is solved online during the ball's free-fall to control the manipulator and catch the ball. The controller utilizes noisy position feedback of the ball from an Intel RealSense D435 depth camera. We propose a novel iterative framework, where data is used to learn the support of the camera noise distribution iteratively in order to update the control policy. The probability of a catch with a fixed policy is computed empirically with a user specified number of roll-outs. Our design guarantees that probability of the catch increases in the limit, as the learned support nears the true support of the camera noise distribution.

We propose a novel O(n(n + v)) linear push policy (n denotes the number of objects, v denotes the maximum number of vertices per object), ClusterPush, that can be efficiently computed using clustering. To evaluate the policy, we define singulation distance as the average pairwise distance of polygon centroids given random arrangements of 2D polygonal objects on a surface, and seek pushing policies that can maximize singulation distance. When compared with a brute force evaluation of all candidate pushes in Box2D simulator using 50,000 pushing scenarios, ClusterPush achieves 70% of the singulation distance achieved using brute force and is 2000x faster. ClusterPush also improves on previous pushing policies and can be used for multi-point pushes with two-point and edge (infinite-point) contacts. Compared with pushes with single-point contacts using ClusterPush, pushes with two-point and edge contacts improve singulation by 7% and 13% respectively. In physical experiments conducted with an ABB YuMi robot on 40 sets of 3-7 blocks, ClusterPush increases singulation distance by 15-30%, outperforming the next best policy by 24% on average.

In this work, we propose a novel labor-efficient deep learning-based model generation scheme, aiming at providing an effective model with less human labeling effort. The key idea is to iteratively generate new training images containing defective beans in various locations by using a generative-adversarial network framework, and these images incur low successful detection rate so that they are useful for improving model quality. Our proposed scheme brings two main impacts to the intelligent agriculture. First, our proposed scheme is the first work to reduce human labeling effort among solutions of vision-based defective bean removal. Second, our scheme can inspect all classes of defective beans categorized by the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) at the same time. The above two advantages increase the degree of automation to the coffee industry. We implement the prototype of the proposed scheme for conducting integrated tests.

To study the potential for machine learning to learn local soil moisture conditions directly from such images, we developed a very fast, linear discrete-time simulation of plant growth based on the Richards equation. We use the simulator to generate large datasets of synthetic aerial images of a vineyard with known moisture conditions and then compare seven methods for inferring moisture conditions from images, in which the “uncorrelated plant” methods look at individual plants and the “correlated field” methods look at the entire vineyard: 1) constant prediction baseline, 2) linear Support Vector Machines (SVM), 3) Random Forests Uncorrelated Plant (RFUP), 4) Random Forests Correlated Field (RFCF), 5) two-layer Neural Networks (NN), 6) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Uncorrelated Plant (CNNUP), and 7) Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Correlated Field (CNNCF). Experiments on held-out test images show that a globally-connected CNN performs best with normalized mean absolute error of 3.4%. Sensitivity experiments suggest that learned global CNNs are robust to injected noise in both the simulator and generated images as well as in the size of the training sets. In simulation, we compare the agricultural standard of flood irrigation to a proportional precision irrigation controller using the output of the global CNN and find that the latter can reduce water consumption by up to 52% and is also robust to errors in irrigation level, location, and timing.

We benchmarked several deep learning detectors for the task of vehicle detection: SSD-VGGNet, SSD-InceptionNet, and SSD-MobileNet, and Faster-RCNN; we found that SSD-VGGNet had the highest precision and quality of bounding boxes. We captured four hours of video streams and used it to train generative models describing both the starting and ending positions of vehicles as well as the trajectories of points traversed.
